We describe an algorithm for checking equivalence of two
programs that manipulate recursive data structures like
lists, strings, and trees.  The first program, called
specification,
is written in a succinct and
safe functional language with algebraic data types.
The second program, called implementation,
is written in C using arrays and pointers.
Our algorithm automatically searches for a bisimulation
relation between the two programs. Our
primary contribution is an algorithm to discharge proof
obligations that may contain expressions that relate
(arbitrarily deep) recursive data structure values across the two
diverse syntaxes. Our equivalence checker, based on this algorithm,
can compute equivalence
of a single abstract specification program with multiple
C implementations that vary in their data layout and
algorithmic strategy.
