\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:eval}

We have implemented \toolName{} on top of the
Counter tool \cite{oopsla20}.
We use {\em four} SMT solvers running in parallel for solving
SMT proof obligations discharged by our proof discharge algorithm:
{\tt z3-4.8.7}, {\tt z3-4.8.14} \cite{z3},
{\tt Yices2-45e38fc} \cite{yices},
and {\tt cvc4-1.7} \cite{cvc4solver}.
An unroll factor of {\em four} is used to handle loop unrolling in the C implementation.
We use a default value of {\em eight} for
over- and under-approximation depths ($d_o$ and $d_u$).
The default value of
our unrolling parameter $k$ (used for categorization of proof obligations) is {\em five}.

\toolName{} requires the user to provide a \SpecL{} program $S$ (specification), a C implementation $C$,
and a file that contains the precondition $Pre$ and postcondition $Post$.
An equivalence check requires the identification of lifting constructors to relate C
values to the ADT values in \SpecL{} through  \recursiveRelations{}.
Such relations may be required at the entry of both programs (i.e. in the precondition $Pre$),
in the middle of both programs (i.e., in the invariants at intermediate product-CFG nodes),
and at the exit of both programs (i.e., in the postcondition $Post$).
$Pre$ and $Post$ are user-specified, whereas the inductive invariants are
inferred automatically by our algorithm.
During invariant inference, \toolName{} derives the candidate lifting constructors
from the user-specified $Pre$ and $Post$.
More sophisticated approaches to finding lifting constructors are left as future work.

\subsection{Experiments}
We consider programs involving four distinct ADTs, namely,
\inv{\small T1} \type{String}, \inv{\small T2} \type{List}, \inv{\small T3} \type{Tree}
and \inv{\small T4} \type{Matrix}.
For each \SpecL{} program specification, we consider multiple
C implementations that differ in their (a) layout and representation of ADTs, and
(b) algorithmic strategies. For example, a \type{Matrix}, in C, may be laid out
in a two-dimensional array, a one-dimensional array using row or column major
layouts etc. On the other hand, an optimized implementation may choose manual vectorization
of an inner-most loop. Next, we consider each ADT in more detail. For each,
we discuss (a) its corresponding programs, (b) C memory layouts and their lifting
constructors, and (c) varying algorithmic strategies.

\subsubsection{String}
We wrote a single specification in \SpecL{} for each of the following
common string library functions: {\tt strlen}, {\tt strchr}, {\tt strcmp}, {\tt strspn},
{\tt strcspn}, and {\tt strpbrk}.  For each specification
program, we took multiple C implementations of that program, drawn from popular
libraries like {\tt glibc} \cite{glibc}, {\tt klibc} \cite{klibc}, {\tt newlib} \cite{newlib},
{\tt openbsd} \cite{openbsdlibc}, {\tt uClibc} \cite{uclibc},
{\tt dietlibc} \cite{dietlibc}, {\tt musl} \cite{musl}, and {\tt netbsd} \cite{netbsd}.
Some of these libraries implement the same function in two ways: one that is optimized
for code size and another that is optimized for runtime.
All these library implementations use a {\em null character} terminated array to represent
a string, and the
corresponding lifting constructor is \lift{str}{\mem{}}{u8[]}.
\type{u<N>} represents the N-bit unsigned integer type in C.
For example, \type{u8} represents \type{unsigned char} type.

Further, we implemented
custom C programs for all of these functions that used
linked list
and {\em chunked linked list} data structures
to represent a string.
In a chunked linked list, a single list node (linked
through a {\tt next} pointer)
contains a small array (chunk) of values.
We use a default chunk size of four for our
benchmarks.
The corresponding lifting constructors are \lift{str}{\mem{}}{lnode(u8)}
and \lift{str}{\mem{}}{clnode(u8)} respectively.
These lifting constructors are defined in \cref{tab:LiftingConsStr}.
\lift{str}{\mem{}}{lnode(u8)} requires a single
argument $p$ representing the pointer to the list node.
On the other hand, \lift{str}{\mem{}}{clnode(u8)} requires two arguments $p$
and $i$, where $p$ represents the pointer to the chunked linked list node
and $i$ represents the position of the initial character in the chunk.

\Cref{fig:strlenSpecAndC} shows the {\tt strlen} specification and two vastly
different $C$ implementations. \Cref{fig:llStrlenCArrIR} is a generic implementation
using a null character terminated array to represent a string similar to a C-style string.
The second implementation in \cref{fig:llStrlenCClistIR} differs from \cref{fig:llStrlenCArrIR}
in the following: (a) it uses a chunked linked list data layout for the input string
and (b) it uses specialized bit manipulations to identify a null character in a chunk at a time.
\toolName{} is able to automatically find a bisimulation relation
for both implementations against the unaltered specification.
\Cref{fig:StrlenProductCFGsAndInvs} shows the product-CFG and invariants for each implementation.

Lifting constructors are named based on the C data layout being lifted
and the \SpecL{} ADT type of the lifted value.
For example, \lift{str}{}{u8[]} represents a \type{String} lifting constructor
for an array layout.
In general, we use the following naming convention for different C data layouts:
\type{T[]} represents an array of type \type{T} (e.g., \type{u8[]}).
\type{lnode(T)} represents a linked list node type containing a value of type \type{T}.
Similarly, \type{clnode(T)} and \type{tnode(T)} represent a chunked linked list and a tree node
with values of type \type{T} respectively.

\subsubsection{List}
We wrote a \SpecL{} program specification that creates a list, a
program that traverses a list to compute the sum of its elements and a program
that computes the dot product of two lists. We use three different
data layouts for a list in C: array (\lift{list}{\mem{}}{u32[]}),
linked list (\lift{list}{\mem{}}{lnode(u32)}), and
a chunked linked list (\lift{list}{\mem{}}{clnode(u32)}).
The lifting constructors are shown in \cref{tab:LiftingConsList}.
Although similar to the String lifting constructors, these lifting
constructors differ widely in their data encoding. For example,
\lifted{list}{\mem{}}{u32[]}{p,i,n} represents a \type{List} value constructed
from a C array $p$ of size $n$ starting at the $i^{th}$ index. The list becomes empty
when we are at the end of the array. (\lift{list}{\mem{}}{lnode(u32)})
and (\lift{list}{\mem{}}{clnode(u32)}), on the other hand, encodes empty
lists (\cons{LNil}) using {\em null pointers}. These layouts are in contrast to the
\type{String} layouts, all of which uses a {\em null character} to
indicate the empty string.

\input{chapters/figures/figLiftingConsTree.tex}

\subsubsection{Tree}
We wrote a \SpecL{} program that sums all the nodes in a tree
through an inorder traversal using recursion. We use two different data layouts for a tree: 
(1) a flat array where a
complete binary tree is laid out in breadth-first search order commonly used for heaps (\lift{tree}{\mem{}}{u32[]}),
and (2) a linked tree node with two pointers for the left and right children (\lift{tree}{\mem{}}{tnode(u32)}) (shown in \cref{tab:LiftingConsTree}).
Both \SpecL{} and C programs contain non-tail recursive procedure calls for left and right children.
\toolName{} is able to correlate these recursive calls using user-provided $Pre$ and $Post$.
At the entry of the recursive calls, \toolName{} is required to prove that $Pre$ holds for the arguments
and at the exit of the recursive calls, \toolName{} assumes $Post$ on the returned states.

\input{chapters/figures/figLiftingConsMatrix.tex}

\subsubsection{Matrix}
We wrote a
\SpecL{} program to count the frequency of a value appearing in a 2D matrix.
A matrix is represented as an ADT that resembles a \type{List} of \type{List}s (\inv{\small T4} in \cref{tab:LiftingConsMatrix}).
The C implementations for a \type{Matrix} object include
(a) a two-dimensional array (\lift{mat}{\mem{}}{u32[][]}), (b) a flattened row-major array (\lift{mat}{\mem{}}{u32[r]}),
(c) a flattened column-major array (\lift{mat}{\mem{}}{u32[c]}), (d) a linked list of 1D arrays (\lift{mat}{\mem{}}{lnode(u32[])}),
(e) a 1D array of linked lists (\lift{mat}{\mem{}}{lnode(u32)[]}) and (f) a 1D array of chunked linked list (\lift{mat}{\mem{}}{clnode(u32)[]})
data layouts. Note that both \type{T[r]} and \type{T[c]} represent a 1D array of type {\tt T}. The {\em r} and {\em c} simply
emphasizes that these arrays are used to represent matrices in row-major and column-major encodings respectively.
We also introduce two auxiliary lifting constructors, \lift{list}{\mem{}}{u32[r]} and \lift{list}{\mem{}}{u32[c]}
for lifting each row of matrices lifted using the corresponding \lift{mat}{\mem{}}{u32[r]} and \lift{mat}{\mem{}}{u32[c]} \type{Matrix} lifting
constructors. These constructors are listed in \cref{tab:LiftingConsMatrix}.

\subsection{Results}
\Cref{tab:results} lists the various C implementations and the time it took
to compute equivalence with their specifications. For functions that
take two or more data structures as arguments, we show
results for different combinations of data layouts for each argument.
We also show the minimum under-approximation ($d_u$) and over-approximation ($d_o$) depths
at which the equivalence proof completed (keeping all other parameters to their
default values).

During the verification of {\tt strchr} and {\tt strpbrk} implementations,
we identified an interesting subtlety. Since {\tt strchr} and {\tt strpbrk}
return null pointers to signify absence of the required character(s) in the input string,
we additionally need to model the UB assumption that the zero
address does not belong to the null character terminated array representing the string.
We use an explicit constructor \cons{SInvalid} to expose this well-formedness property in a \SpecL{} \type{String}.
Furthermore, we relate \cons{SInvalid} to the condition of C character pointer being null using the
lifting constructors \lifted{str}{\mem{}}{T}{p\ctype{i32},\dots} (as defined in \cref{tab:LiftingConsList}).
These lifting constructors are used as part of $Pre$ to equate $S$ and $C$ input strings.
Finally in $S$, we model the absence of \cons{SInvalid} in the input string as a UB assumption using
the {\tt assuming-do} statement introduced in \cref{sec:speclang}.
Due to the \sdef{} assumption, this constraints the inputs to $S$ as well as $C$ to well-formed strings only.
This is an example where \sdef{} and $Pre$ can be used to model wellformedness of values in $C$.

TODO: add strlen spec atleast, show the strchr also!! maybe some matrix data layouts (only layouts)
