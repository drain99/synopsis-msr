Sunday: finalize formalism, evaluation, conclusion sections
list, tree, matrix sections : add subtables, edit text and refer to table
add figure for matrix data layouts along with the c function signatures

Monday: fully finish the examples and send to sir with the following points:
how I plan to introduce the program graph concept, should i put it in synopsis?
