Title slide
Intro to the problem and its possible applications
Background on different approaches to its solution
Example spec and c programs : introduce spec in a line or two, then contrast their differences
Objective : show equivalence between both automatically through bisimulation
Bisimulation : Intro shortly
Contributions : bisimulation based algorithm with 3 steps + focus on the proof discharge algorithm + if time permits, a bit more on the other 2 steps
Introduce the unified IR and CFG representations for the spec and c programs
Product program and show the example with invariants table
Recursive relations
Proof Discharge Algorithm
Decomposition of recursive relations
Unrolling of recursive relations
Categorization
Type I : 2 slides, 1 for each example
Type II : 2 slides, 1 for each example, then 1 slide for the approximation schemes, 2 slides for the 2 examples again
Type III : 1 slide for example, 1 slide for rewriting and decomposition, 1 slide for 3 subproblems and simplification of each, 1 slide to introduce deconstruction program, 1 slide for bisimulation, 1 slide for points-to analysis, 1 slide for points-to results for C and then on the deconstruction programs
Proof Discharge Summary
Evaluation : Introduce the tool and write the benchmarks considered
Show the 3 layouts for a string and their lifting constructors
Show the strlen programs and their product CFG with invariants
List the other ADTs and their layouts considered
Thank you slide

TODO:
C2 -> C6 -> CE => ch is at top, either its null or an actual character
C2 -> C3 -> C4 -> CE => ch is not zero but top is zero i.e. end of string

S1 -> S3 -> S4 -> SE => empty string and also ch is zero
S1 -> S3 -> S7 -> SE => non-empty string but equal actual characters
S1 -> S3 -> S4 -> S5 -> SE => empty string but ch is non zero

so the single exit path (1) correlates with (1) & (2) of Spec!!!
perfect example where pathset is a requirement

so TODO first thing tomorrow:
*(0) check the code that indeed both pathconds are added!!
*(1) add pathset small text in correlation algo
*(2) in proof discharge algo, say how to reduce it into paths in the proof algo first subsection
(3) add OptStr to the table along with definitions
(4) update and add the strchr figures to evaluation
(5) discuss the following - (a) use of OptStr (b) use of (S def) (c) pathset correlation i.e. generalization in C while Spec is more explicit!
*(6) do a pass over the proof discharge algo section excluding value graphs and send to sir
