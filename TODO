Title slide
Intro to the problem and its possible applications
Background on different approaches to its solution
Example spec and c programs : introduce spec in a line or two, then contrast their differences
Objective : show equivalence between both automatically through bisimulation
Bisimulation : Intro shortly
Contributions : bisimulation based algorithm with 3 steps + focus on the proof discharge algorithm + if time permits, a bit more on the other 2 steps
Introduce the unified IR and CFG representations for the spec and c programs
Product program and show the example with invariants table
Recursive relations
Proof Discharge Algorithm
Decomposition of recursive relations
Unrolling of recursive relations
Categorization
Type I : 2 slides, 1 for each example
Type II : 2 slides, 1 for each example, then 1 slide for the approximation schemes, 2 slides for the 2 examples again
Type III : 1 slide for example, 1 slide for rewriting and decomposition, 1 slide for 3 subproblems and simplification of each, 1 slide to introduce deconstruction program, 1 slide for bisimulation, 1 slide for points-to analysis, 1 slide for points-to results for C and then on the deconstruction programs
Proof Discharge Summary
Evaluation : Introduce the tool and write the benchmarks considered
Show the 3 layouts for a string and their lifting constructors
Show the strlen programs and their product CFG with invariants
List the other ADTs and their layouts considered
Thank you slide

TODO: 
finish data collection
DONE
split the table into two tables:
- include the following columns for each: {# of backtracking}, {# of Type I queries (Proven,Disproven,Timeout)}, {# of Type II queries (Proven,Disproven,Timeout)}, {# of Type III queries (Proven,Timeout)}
DONE
add a new table, show the full distribution of queries along with the distribution of depth. I want to show a bar chart but let's decide and finish this as well
DONE
add accompanying text with the updated stuff:
- explain the new tables in caption and in text DONE
- importance of counterexample-guided search : improved search order DONE
- importance of counterexample-generation : type II algorithm is a 58% of all queries, generating CE is very important for this type! DONE
- 1-2 lines on the iterative-deepening like proof discharge and the depth distribution chart DONE
- add the limitation section
  - first create the sources for the 2 examples DONE
  - writing is easy. max of 5-10 lines DONE
  - format DONE
- add the appendix section with all the specification functions
  - write the sources DONE
  - write the text DONE
  - figure out formatting for appendix section DONE
2h to do this!
do final formatting passes
- format tables and chart properly
update Q(P,D,U) alignment, erase all texts and readd in latex somehow, approx depth can be ignored maybe DONE
