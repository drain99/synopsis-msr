Conclusion and Future Scope

Sunday: finalize formalism, evaluation, conclusion sections
list, tree, matrix sections : add subtables, edit text and refer to table
add figure for matrix data layouts along with the c function signatures

Monday: fully finish the examples and send to sir with the following points:
how I plan to introduce the program graph concept, should i put it in synopsis?

Synopsis Contents:

Introduction (5 pages)
  Introduce the top-level problem : taken from intro + related work
  Take the example and define the constrains of the problem we are setting to solve : intro with example
  Shortly on IRs, CFGs and product program : existing text
  Our contributions : proof discharge algorithm + recovery of counterexamples to aid in our algorithm
Proof Discharge Algorithm (10 pages)
  Shortly describe lifting constructors and recursive relations
  Introduce decomposition archieved through partial unification under a rewriting system
  Go through each of the 3 types in vague detail taking examples for each and writing about them
  Talk on the usefulness of the counterexamples : counterexample-guided correlation and invariant inference procedures (borrow heavily from Counter, state shortly on what differs)
Evaluation : put a lot of focus, try to almost everything in including the table except the lifting constructor : MUST SHOW THE STRLEN EXAMPLE (5 pages)
Conclusion : limitations (scaling for size of SMT queries, non-bisimilar specification and implementation), then whatevers is in conclusion (1 pages)

TODOS:
end of week finish this synopsis thingy
end of next week finish the program graph chapter
